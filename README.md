# ü¶ì üîó ZebraChain

[![Build Status](https://github.com/zebrafactory/zebrachain/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zebrafactory/zebrachain/actions)

ZebraChain is a logged, quantum safe signing protocol designed to replace the long lived asymmetric
key pairs used to sign software releases (and to sign other super important stuff).

In short, ZebraChain:

* Logs each signature in a block chain

* Changes the keypairs at every signature by including the public key used to sign the current
block and the hash of the public key that will be used to sign the next block

* Is quantum secure because it uses ML-DSA + ed25519 in a hybrid signing construction (as
recommended by the ML-DSA authors)

This is a pre-release crate. The API is still being finalized. The 0.0.x releases make no API commitments, nor any
commits to the protocol.

However, the dust is settling quickly and it's a perfect time to jump in and start building
experimental applications on top of ZebraChain!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

ZebraChain is not yet suitable for production use.

This is a nascent implementation of a yet to be finalized protocol. It's also built on a quite new
Rust implementation of [ML-DSA](https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/tree/master/ml-dsa) that
has its own security warning.

## ü¶ì Overview

Consider the GPG key used to sign updates for your favorite Linux distribution.  You could replace
it with a ZebraChain, gaining some important benefits over the GPG key:

* Each signature is a new block in a blockchain, with a back-reference to the hash of the previous
block.  This creates a robust, publicly verifiable log of every signature that has be made using a
specific ZebraChain.

* A given asymmetric key pair is only used *once!* Each block contains the signature, the
corresponding public key used to sign the block, and a *forward-reference* to the *hash* of the
corresponding public key that will be used to sign the *next* block. This allows new entropy to be
introduced at each signature, minimizing the problem of whether there was high enough quality
entropy when the ZebraChain was created.

* Entropy accumulation throughout the lifetime of a ZebraChain. At each signature, a new call to
`getrandom()` is made. This new entropy is securely mixed with the current seed (using a keyed
hash), and the result is the next seed. Want to rotate your keys? Just make a new signature.

* Quantum safe. ZebraChain uses the recently standardized
[FIPS 204 ML-DSA](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final) quantum secure algorithm in a hybrid
construction with the classically secure [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) algorithm (as
recommended by the ML-DSA authors). Support for
[FIPS 205 SLH-DSA](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final) will be added soon.

## üßë‚Äçüè≠ Development Status

The current implementation has low abstraction and is not configurable, making it easy to review the
protocol. So please jump in and help! Feedback and pull requests welcome!

The next step is to make the implementation configurable for single, double, and triple hybrid
signing with ed25519, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA, supporting all ML-DSA and SLH-DSA parameter sets.
Likewise, the hash function and digest size needs to be configurable.

The Payload also needs to be abstracted into a trait to allow higher level code to define the size
of payload and interpret its contents as needed.

The current ZebraChain API is close to what it will be as the dust settles, except for it will
soon be generic on two items: something that implements a parameter trait and something that
implements a payload trait.

## ü¶Ä Dependencies of Interest

ZebraChain is built on existing implementations of established cryptographic primitives.

These key crates are used:

* [ed25519-dalek](https://crates.io/crates/ed25519-dalek) and [ml-dsa](https://crates.io/crates/ml-dsa) for hybrid signing.

* [blake2](https://crates.io/crates/blake2) for hashing and KDF.

* [chacha20poly1305](https://crates.io/crates/chacha20poly1305) for encrypting and authenticating the secret blocks.

* [argon2](https://crates.io/crates/argon2) for PBKDF.

## üîó Wire Format

A ZebraChain block has 8 fields:

```
HASH || SIG || PUB || NEXT_PUB_HASH || PAYLOAD || INDEX || CHAIN_HASH || PREV_HASH
```

Where:

```
HASH = hash(SIG || PUB || NEXT_PUB_HASH || PAYLOAD || INDEX || CHAIN_HASH || PREV_HASH)
```

And where:

```
SIG = sign(PUB || NEXT_PUB_HASH || PAYLOAD || INDEX || CHAIN_HASH || PREV_HASH)
```

The `PUB` field contains both ML-DSA and ed25519 public keys:

```
PUB = PUB_ML_DSA || PUB_ED25519
```

And the `SIG` field contains both ML-DSA and ed25519 signatures:

```
SIG = SIG_ML_DSA || SIG_ED25519
```

Where:

```
SIG_ED25519 = sign_ed25519(SIGNABLE)
```

And where:

```
SIG_ML_DSA = sign_ml_dsa(SIG_ED25519 || SIGNABLE)
```

(Note that ML-DSA signs both the ed22519 signature and the signable portion of the block.)

The `PAYLOAD` field is the content being signed. Currently it contains a timestamp and a hash,
but it will soon be reworked into a trait, allowing higher level code to define the the size of
the payload and interpret the payload content however needed.

## üññ Code of Conduct

We follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html),

* We respect the rights to privacy and anonymity for contributors and people in
  the community.  If someone wishes to contribute under a pseudonym different to
  their primary identity, that wish is to be respected by all contributors.

## ü¶Ä MSRV Policy

The Minimum Supported Rust Version is whatever the current stable Rust release is when a ZebraChain
release is made.

ZebraChain releases are made weekly (on Thursdays), and when that Thursday happens to correspond
with a Rust release, the MSRV is bumped.

## ü¶Ä SemVer Policy

There will be one. There is not one yet and there wont be one till the 0.1.0 release.
